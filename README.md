- <b>Admino Script (Linux System Administration Script) </b>
  - [Bash script with improved Linux security functions.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/adminoScript)
- <b>LAB Achivements</b>
<b>Advanced Penetration Testing & Exploit Development</b>
  - Implemented a custom secure transport protocol in C using the C Socket API and libsodium, ensuring end-to-end encrypted communication resistant to MITM attacks.
  - Conducted advanced network analysis with Wireshark, retrieving and decrypting sensitive data files. Demonstrated skills in forensic recovery and real-time traffic analysis.
  - Developed and executed buffer overflow exploits, using gdb and pwntools to bypass modern OS defenses, successfully escalating privileges in a controlled lab environment.
  - Performed successful privilege escalation using setgid and ltrace for dynamic analysis in Linux environments, bypassing security mechanisms.
  - Exploited web application vulnerabilities in a controlled pentesting lab, using SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks to manipulate user accounts, bypass authentication, and perform privilege escalation.
  - Executed complex cache poisoning and HTTP smuggling attacks using Burp Suite, demonstrating proficiency in web application security.
  - Identified and exploited algorithmic complexity attacks and side channels in a controlled pentesting lab environment. Successfully induced denial-of-service conditions and recovered hidden data by manipulating server-side processing and response times.

<b>Digital Forensics</b>
  - Conducted full digital forensic analysis of a Windows and Mobil systems, extracting registry hives, shell items, LNK files, and prefetch data using Autopsy, FTK Imager, Arsenal Image Mounter.
  - Performed timeline analysis of system events to reconstruct user activity, detecting data exfiltration attempts, unauthorized software installations, and suspicious login patterns.
  - Utilized YARA rules to detect and classify malware artifacts, leveraging Thor, Loki, and Volatility for memory forensics.
  - Authored a full forensic investigation report, presenting detailed evidence analysis, forensic methodologies, and conclusive findings for legal and internal security teams in accordance with NIST 800-86 and ISO 27037 guidelines.
  - Exercised Linux system administration by managing user accounts, groups, and file permissions. Configured access controls, monitored login events, and ensured system integrity through regular security updates and patch management.

<b>Security Research & Bug Bounty (Ongoing)</b>
  - Actively testing web applications in Bug Bounty programs (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti), refining skills in recon, SQLi, XSS, authentication security, and access control testing.
  - Configured and hardened SSH security by generating and managing key pairs. Practiced PGP key signing, encryption, decryption, and message authentication, reinforcing secure communication techniques.
  - Practicing responsible disclosure methodology by identifying and reporting potential security misconfigurations in real-world applications.
  - Leveraging Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom Python scripts for vulnerability testing and exploit development.
  - Working on automating reconnaissance and common attack payloads to improve bug bounty workflow.
