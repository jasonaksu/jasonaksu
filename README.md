<h2>👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

- <b>nScan Network Scanner (Python)</b>
  - [Providing a versatile tool for network administration and cyber security professionals to identify and assess network vulnerabilities.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/nScan)
- <b>Password Cracker (Python)</b>
  - [Python based Password cracker using dictionary attack.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/passCracker)
- <b>SecureComm (A C program that establishes a secure TCP connection to a server.) </b>
  - [Sends encrypted messages and verifies the integrity of the responses.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/SecureComm)
- <b>RSA Algorithm (RSA Key Generator - Python) </b>
  - [RSA encryption and decryption system with generating prime number keys](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/%20rsaAlgorithm)
- <b>Admino Script (Linux System Administration Script) </b>
  - [Bash script with improved Linux security functions.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/adminoScript)
- <b>LAB Achivements</b>
<b>Advanced Penetration Testing & Exploit Development</b>
•	Implemented a custom secure transport protocol in C using the C Socket API and libsodium, ensuring end-to-end encrypted communication resistant to MITM attacks.
•	Conducted advanced network analysis with Wireshark, retrieving and decrypting sensitive data files. Demonstrated skills in forensic recovery and real-time traffic analysis.
•	Developed and executed buffer overflow exploits, using gdb and pwntools to bypass modern OS defenses, successfully escalating privileges in a controlled lab environment.
•	Performed successful privilege escalation using setgid and ltrace for dynamic analysis in Linux environments, bypassing security mechanisms.
•	Exploited web application vulnerabilities in a controlled pentesting lab, using SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks to manipulate user accounts, bypass authentication, and perform privilege escalation.
•	Executed complex cache poisoning and HTTP smuggling attacks using Burp Suite, demonstrating proficiency in web application security.
•	Identified and exploited algorithmic complexity attacks and side channels in a controlled pentesting lab environment. Successfully induced denial-of-service conditions and recovered hidden data by manipulating server-side processing and response times.
