- <b>Password Cracker (Python)</b>
  - [Python based Password cracker using dictionary attack.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/passCracker)
- <b>SecureComm (A C program that establishes a secure TCP connection to a server.) </b>
  - [Sends encrypted messages and verifies the integrity of the responses.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/SecureComm)
- <b>RSA Algorithm (RSA Key Generator - Python) </b>
  - [RSA encryption and decryption system with generating prime number keys](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/%20rsaAlgorithm)
- <b>Admino Script (Linux System Administration Script) </b>
  - [Bash script with improved Linux security functions.](https://github.com/jasonaksu/CY_Projects/tree/main/adminoScript)

- <b>LAB PROJECTS & HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE</b>

<b>Advanced Penetration Testing & Exploit Development</b>
  - Implemented ecure client-server communication in C using the C Socket API and libsodium, ensuring encrypted, integrity-protected messaging. Designed a retry mechanism for corrupted transmissions and processed responses via secure hashing and base64 encoding.
  - Conducted advanced network analysis with Wireshark, retrieving and decrypting sensitive data files. Demonstrated skills in forensic recovery and real-time traffic analysis.
  - Developed and executed buffer overflow exploits to bypass ASLR and NX protections in a remote exploitation challenge. Crafted a NOP sled and brute-forced return addresses to execute shellcode successfully and gain a reverse shell. Used dynamic payload adjustments to optimize exploit reliability.
  - Exploited setgid binaries in Linux via ltrace, identifying command injection and environment manipulation to escalate privileges and execute restricted binaries.
  - Exploited web application vulnerabilities in a controlled pentesting lab, using SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks to manipulate user accounts, bypass authentication, and perform privilege escalation.
  - Launched a cache poisoning-based denial-of-service (CPDoS) attack on a web application by manipulating HTTP caching behavior. Used Burp Suite to refine payloads and bypass layered defenses with HTTP smuggling.
  - Exploited algorithmic complexity and side-channel vulnerabilities in a web application, inducing denial-of-service via comput

<b>Digital Forensics</b>
  - Conducted forensic analysis of Windows and macOS systems, extracting system artifacts (registry hives, shell items, LNK files, and prefetch data) using FTK Imager, Arsenal Image Mounter, and specialized forensic parsers.
  - Performed mobile device analysis using Autopsy, recovering deleted call logs, SMS, contacts, and application data for forensic reporting.
  - Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark, correlating event logs to detect data exfiltration attempts and unauthorized software installations.
  - Performed timeline analysis to reconstruct user activity, tracking suspicious login patterns and identifying forensic artifacts relevant to investigations.
  - Authored a comprehensive forensic report, documenting evidence collection, methodology, and findings, aligning with NIST 800-86 and ISO 27037 guidelines for legal and internal security teams.
  - Practiced chain of custody procedures for digital evidence collection, storage, and preservation, ensuring forensic integri

<b>Security Research & Bug Bounty (Ongoing)</b>
  - Actively testing web applications in Bug Bounty programs (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti), refining skills in recon, SQLi, XSS, authentication security, and access control testing.
  - Configured and hardened SSH security by generating and managing key pairs. Practiced PGP key signing, encryption, decryption, and message authentication, reinforcing secure communication techniques.
  - Practicing responsible disclosure methodology by identifying and reporting potential security misconfigurations in real-world applications.
  - Leveraging Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom Python scripts for vulnerability testing and exploit dev
